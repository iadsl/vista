## Overview

VISTA is a research project focused on making complex spatiotemporal prediction models more interpretable. By combining interactive visualization tools with advanced data analysis techniques, VISTA aims to help users confidently explore and leverage AI predictions across various domains.

## Why VISTA?

Spatiotemporal prediction models can be powerful yet challenging to interpret. VISTA addresses this gap by providing visual analytics and transparent insights into **why** and **how** models arrive at certain predictions. Our approach helps researchers, policymakers, and other stakeholders make more informed decisions.

## Key Features

- **Interactive Visualizations**: Explore data and model outputs via dynamic, user-friendly interfaces.  
- **Explainability**: Gain insights into the factors driving AI predictions.  
- **Domain Versatility**: Adaptable to fields like criminology, healthcare, environmental studies, and more.

## Project Highlights

1. **Feature Exploration**: Employ techniques like sensitivity analysis and activation maximization to identify crucial predictors.  
2. **End-User Empowerment**: Focus on usability for domain experts with minimal technical backgrounds.  
3. **Multi-Domain Impact**: Provide solutions for real-world challenges in crime analysis, healthcare, urban planning, and beyond.
