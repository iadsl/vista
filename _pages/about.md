**Welcome to VISTA**

VISTA (**V**isual **I**nsights for **S**patio**t**emporal **A**nalytics) is a research initiative dedicated to making complex spatiotemporal prediction models more understandable and transparent through the power of visual analytics. We aim to bridge the gap between cutting-edge AI technologies and their practical applications, empowering users to interpret and trust the decisions made by AI systems.


**Why VISTA?**

Spatiotemporal prediction models are widely used to tackle challenges across diverse fields, such as:
- Crime Analysis: Identifying potential hotspots and trends to enhance public safety.
- Healthcare: Predicting disease outbreaks or tracking patient outcomes over time and space.
- Urban Planning: Simulating the impact of city developments and environmental changes.
  
While these models are powerful, their complexity often makes them difficult to interpret. VISTA addresses this by combining **interactive visualization tools** with **advanced data analysis techniques**, helping domain experts explore, understand, and leverage AI predictions.

**Key Features**

- Interactive Visualizations: Dive deep into the data through dynamic, user-friendly interfaces.
- Explainability: Gain insights into how and why models make specific predictions.
- Domain Versatility: Adaptable for use in criminology, healthcare, environmental studies, and more.

**Project Highlights**

1. Feature Exploration: Using sensitivity analysis and activation maximization to identify key factors driving predictions.
2. End-User Empowerment: Designing tools that prioritize usability for non-technical experts.
3. Multi-Domain Impact: Providing solutions tailored to real-world challenges in multiple sectors.
